    <h2>Let's Learn about media Query</h2>
    <p>
        Media Query is basically like a condition used to switch between
        styles which is written according to the needs. <br>
        The Background of this page is set to turn blue once the width turns less than
        720 px.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only the properties defined in media queries get overwitten, rest stays the same.

    <h3>Always Design For Mobile First</h3>
    <p>
        Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for
        desktop or any other device (This will make the
        page display faster on smaller devices). <br>

        This means that we must make some changes in our CSS. <br>

        Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px,
        we should change the design when the width
        gets larger than 768px. This will make our design Mobile First: <br>

    <h3>Orientation: Portrait / Landscape</h3>

        Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page
        depending on the orientation of the browser.

        You can have a set of CSS properties that will only apply when the
        browser window is wider than its height, a so called "Landscape"
        orientation:
    </p>
    <p>
        I set the Background to change to yellow in Landscape mode. <br>
        However don't know how to merge these media query together like, If i want
        to create combinations of Landscape with different width and potrait different.
